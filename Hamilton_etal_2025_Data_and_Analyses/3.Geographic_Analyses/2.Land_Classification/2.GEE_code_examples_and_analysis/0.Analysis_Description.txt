For each of 10 populations on Long Island and in New York City, New York:

	Perform Classification and Regression analysis (supervised machine learning) with an iterative data-building process:	

		Define the data-type to be used (NAIP 2019 data for this study)		

		Select analysis region on map profile in Google Earth Engine

		Manually select 50 representative data points, randomizing them into training (80%) and testing sets (20%)

		Randomly select 50 data points for a secondary "fully" random testing set

		Run classification and regression model

		Export all points and manually assign classes to the testing sets as validation

		Import the 3 training and testing sets into the next script to build datasets and make them directly comparable

		Continue until overtraining is observed, go 1 or 2 sets further

		Run to the maximum number of points used across all populations to homogenize sampling

The 1-6 labeled scripts in this folder represent all of the analysis scripts for 1 of 10 populations for which this analysis was performed. Accuracies for both testing sets for all populations can be found in the upper level folder "2.Land_Classification".
